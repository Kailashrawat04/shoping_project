### 1.4 Scope of the Project
The project encompasses:
- Frontend development using React.js with modern UI components
- Backend development with Node.js and Express.js
- MongoDB database for data storage
- User authentication and authorization system
- Product catalog management
- Shopping cart functionality
- Order processing system
- Admin dashboard for business management

### 1.5 Methodology
The project follows an Agile development methodology with iterative development cycles. The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) was chosen for its efficiency and scalability in building full-stack applications.
